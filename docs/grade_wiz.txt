========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all global requirements
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases
[ ] - Your game should have a map with at least two visually distinct tile types.
[ ] - The TA debugger should correctly show MTVs for circle-circle and AAB-AAB collisions.
[ ] - Your game should have a unit that the player can move freely.

Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[X] - Your engine must be able to calculate MTVs in addition to normal collision calculations.

Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[X] - Handin meets all playtesting requirements.
[X] - The TA debugger should be extended to display the respective MTVs for all collision pairs. TAs should quickly be able to verify that the correct MTV is being calculated.
[X] - One of the tile types should be passable.  One should be impassable
[X] - The player-controlled unit should not be able to enter the impassable tiles. The unit should
be able to enter passable tiles.
[X] - Your game never crashes.

Secondary Engine Requirements
=======================================
[X] - Handin meets all primary engine requirements
[X] - Your engine must implement a procedural map generation algorithm (space partitioning or
similar complexity) OR support level loading from a text file.
[X] - Your engine must correctly suppport an animation behavior.

Secondary Game Requirements
======================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary game requirements
[ X] - Your game must use a procedurally generated map OR a map loaded from a level file.
	[ ] - If using a procedurally generated map, the player must be able to select a seed either using a text box or using buttons with
pre-selected seed.
[X] - Your game must include a sprite animation.
[X] - Your game must meet at least two of the extra game requirements (see the wiz extras doc for
a list of ideas)

Global Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[ ] - Eclipse project or ant build file
[ ] - README
    [ ] - has a copy of the rubric
    [ ] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [ ] - documents known bugs
    [ ] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[ ] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Engine and game in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game logically separated
[ ] - Engine and game code isn't horribly designed
    [ ] - No game logic is handled outside of the game world
    [ ] - Most game logic is contained within behaviors
    [ ] - GameObjects do not gain any functionality from inheritance
    [ ] - Behaviors are extensible- no hardcoding required to add new behaviors
    [ ] - Systems are extensible- minimal hardcoding required to add new systems
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin isn't permanent fixed size
[ ] - Handin runs 20+ UPS
