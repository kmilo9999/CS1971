Game Idea

I would like to work on a scape room 2d game, where the player needs to overcome a series of obstacle to go out of a place.
There is a hall where some tiles activate tramps such as falling rocks, bullets. ALso there is a hall where the walls moves 
shringking the size of the hall and smashing our player. etc

Toy:

It could be a hero on an indiana jones custome. 

Engine:

Implement particle effects, dynamic terrain and achivments.

Gameplay:
a top down game where the player controls a character using the keyboard. the hero is human and it will die with just one hit.
he has two items, a shovel to mofify the terrain around him and a whip to attack enemies.
