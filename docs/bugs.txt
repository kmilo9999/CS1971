It doesnt resize the game elements on the screen. I did not know how to implement this funcitonality
It does pan, but no zoom
panning the camera causes wrong clipping at the edges of the game viewport
the movement of the elements from the menu to the game viewport is not smooth
destroying tow elements crearte two new elemets instead of one.
