========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[x] - Your game must contain a player-controlled unit above an immobile platform
[x] - The player-controlled unit must fall in the air
[x] - The player-controlled unit should not fall through the platform


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[X] - Your engine must correctly implement a PhysicsBehavior that holds and updates mass, force, impulse, velocity, and restitution to generate a physically correct response to collisions
[X] - Your engine should be able to handle static objects (other PhysicsBehaviors should collide with static objects, but static objects shouldn't accumulate force or impulse)

Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[X] - The player should have a constant downward acceleration
[X] - The player should be able to jump only when standing on a platform (double-jumping and wall-jumping are allowed)
[X] - Your game must have three objects with visibly different restitution values that can collide with each other.
[X] - It must be possible to start a new game without restarting the program


Secondary Engine Requirements
=======================================
[X] - Handin meets all primary engine requirements
[] - Your engine must support collisions and MTVs with convex polygons

Secondary Game Requirements
======================================
[X] - Handin meets all primary game requirements
[X] - The TA debuger should be extended to show collisions and MTVs with convex polygons
[] - Your game should include a convex polygon


Global Playtesting Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[X] - Eclipse project or ant build file
[X] - No external dependencies
[X] - Handin runs on department machines
[X] - Handin runs 20+ UPS
[X] - Handin only crashes on edge cases

Global Primary Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[X] - README
    [X] - has a copy of the rubric
    [X] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [x] - documents known bugs
    [X] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[X] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[X] - Engine and game in separate packages
[X] - Engine and game logically separated
[X] - Engine code is well designed
[X] - Game code is reasonably designed
[X] - Handin isn't permanent fixed size
[X] - Handin never crashes
[X] - Handin meets all playtesting requirements
