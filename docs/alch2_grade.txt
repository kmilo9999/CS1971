[X] - Completed playtesting

========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[ ] - Handin meets all global requirements
[X] - Handin only crashes on edge cases
[X] - Element is displayed in viewport
[X] - Element can be moved around the workspace
[X] - Element is rendered using a sprite

Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[x] - Engine supports collisions between points, circles, and AABs
[x] - This is done using a collision system and collision behavior
[x] - Collision checking is done using double dispatch (or with similarly clean implementation)

Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[x] - You have the TA debugger
[X] - The debugger has been completed to quickly and accurately show collisions between any pair of:
    [X] - points
    [x] - circles
    [x] - AABs
    [] - compound shapes
[x] - You have:
	[x] - two base elements in the menu
	[x] - which can be copied and dragged into the workspace
	[x] - without destroying or moving the original, and
	[x] - which can combine to make a new element

Secondary Engine Requirements
=======================================
[X] - Handin meets all primary engine requirements
[x] - Engine supports a sprite behavior
[x] - Spritesheets/sprites are only loaded once

Secondary Game Requirements
======================================
[X] - Handin meets all primary game requirements
[x] - All elements have unique sprites & use sprite behavior
[ ] - Elements are deleted when they are dragged from the work-space to the menu
[X] - You have at least:
	[X] - four base elements
	[X] - three non-base elements
	[X] - one final element

Global Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[X] - Eclipse project or ant build file
[X] - README
    [x] - has a copy of the rubric
    [X] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [X] - documents known bugs
    [X] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[X] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[X] - No external dependencies
[X] - Engine and game in separate packages
[X] - Engine and game logically separated
[X] - Engine code isn't horribly designed
[ ] - Game code isn't horribly designed
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin isn't permanent fixed size
[X] - Handin runs 20+ UPS
