========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[X] - Your game should have a map containing passable and impassable tiles
[X] - Your game must have a unit that can be controlled by the player
[X] - Your game must have an enemy unit that moves deterministically
[X] - There must be a visible reaction when the player and enemy collide
[X] - Your game must have a stationary item on the ground
[] - There must be a (different) visible reaction when the player and item collide


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[X] - Your engine must support A* pathfinding
[X] - Your engine must implement an AI library
    [X] - If  using behavior trees, you must implement the following:
        [X] - Behavior Tree class
        [X] - Selector class
        [X] - Sequence class
        [X] - Action interface
        [X] - Condition interface
    [ ] - If using GOAP, you must implement the following:
        [ ] - Game State class
        [ ] - Action class/interface
        [ ] - Condition class/interface
        [ ] - You should be able to search over the Action set using a starting Game State and a goal Condition using your engine's A* implementation (can use a heuristic of 0, or allow the game to define its own)

Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[X] - The enemy unit should use your engine's AI framework.
    [X] - All AI tools included in the engine requirements should be used
    [X] - At least two distinct behaviors must be used and visible during gameplay
[X] - It must be possible to start a new game without restarting the program


Secondary Engine Requirements
=======================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary engine requirements

Secondary Game Requirements
======================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary game requirements
[X] - The enemy unit must move according to a path generated using A*
[X] - The game must meet at least two of the extra game requirements that weren't used last week
    [X] - List all four game requirements in your README and specify which ones are for tac3 and which are tac4


Global Playtesting Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[X] - Eclipse project or ant build file
[X] - No external dependencies
[X] - Handin runs on department machines
[X] - Handin runs 20+ UPS
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases

Global Primary Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[X] - README
    [X] - has a copy of the rubric
    [X] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [X] - documents known bugs
    [X] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[X] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[X] - Engine and game in separate packages
[X] - Engine and game logically separated
[X] - Engine code is well designed
[X] - Game code is reasonably designed
[ ] - Handin isn't permanent fixed size
[ ] - Handin never crashes
[ ] - Handin meets all playtesting requirements
