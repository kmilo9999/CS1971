========================================

Playtesting Requirements
========================================
[X] - Your game must contain a player-controlled unit above an immobile platform
[X] - The player-controlled unit must fall in the air
[X] - The player-controlled unit should not fall through the platform


Primary Engine Requirements
========================================
[X] - Your engine must correctly implement a PhysicsBehavior that holds and updates mass, force, impulse, velocity, and restitution to generate a physically correct response to collisions
[X] - Your engine should be able to handle static objects (other PhysicsBehaviors should collide with static objects, but static objects shouldn't accumulate force or impulse)

Primary Game Requirements
========================================
[X] - The player should have a constant downward acceleration
[X] - The player should be able to jump only when standing on a platform (double-jumping and wall-jumping are allowed)
[] - Your game must have three objects with visibly different restitution values that can collide with each other.
[ ] - It must be possible to start a new game without restarting the program


Secondary Engine Requirements
=======================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary engine requirements
[ ] - Your engine must support collisions and MTVs with convex polygons

Secondary Game Requirements
======================================
[ ] - Handin meets all primary game requirements
[ ] - The TA debuger should be extended to show collisions and MTVs with convex polygons
[ ] - Your game should include a convex polygon


Global Playtesting Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[ ] - Eclipse project or ant build file
[ ] - No external dependencies
[ ] - Handin runs on department machines
[ ] - Handin runs 20+ UPS
[ ] - Handin only crashes on edge cases

Global Primary Requirements (you don't need to show how to verify these)
======================================
[ ] - README
    [ ] - has a copy of the rubric
    [ ] - shows how to verify non-global requirements
    [ ] - documents known bugs
    [ ] - approximate hours to complete checkpoint
[ ] - INSTRUCTIONS file included
[ ] - Engine and game in separate packages
[ ] - Engine and game logically separated
[ ] - Engine code is well designed
[ ] - Game code is reasonably designed
[ ] - Handin isn't permanent fixed size
[ ] - Handin never crashes
[ ] - Handin meets all playtesting requirements
