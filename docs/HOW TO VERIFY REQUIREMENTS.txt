Primary Engine Requirements

 - Your engine must correctly implement a PhysicsBehavior that holds and updates mass, force, impulse, velocity, and restitution to generate a physically correct response to collisions
    Check class: fxengine.components.PhysicsComponent: It has the physic attributes of gameobjects such as mass, velocit, restitution.
    Check class: fxengine.collision.PhysicsCollision: It resolve the collisions betwwen objects usignt the COR
 
 - Your engine should be able to handle static objects (other PhysicsBehaviors should collide with static objects, but static objects shouldn't accumulate force or impulse)
    Check class: fxengine.system.PhysicsSystem::applyGravity() and fxengine.system.PhysicsSystem::applyImpulse() where I check if the object is static.



Primary Game Requirements
========================================

  - The player should have a constant downward acceleration: The player starts in the air and falls due to gravity. If you press SPACE it will jump
  - The player should be able to jump only when standing on a platform (double-jumping and wall-jumping are allowed): press SPACE on a platform. In mid air it wont jump.


It took me a TON of time to get this far  :D.
