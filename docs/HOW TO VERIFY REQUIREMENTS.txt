Primary Engine Requirements

 - Your engine must support A* pathfinding: fxengine.PathFinding.PathFinding . This class is used inside the GameTileMap class whenever a path from two nodes is requested
 - Your engine must implement an AI library
     [X] - If  using behavior trees, you must implement the following:
         - Behavior Tree class : check class fxengine.behaviortree
         - Selector class : fxengine.behaviortree.Selector
         - Sequence class : fxengine.behaviortree.Sequence
         - Action interface: fxengine.behaviortree.Action
         - Condition interface: fxengine.behaviortree.Condition

Primary Game Requirements

  - The enemy unit should use your engine's AI framework. : chekc the class Level1 and level2, where the enemies are initialized.
                                                         The behavior tree is initialized, and added to the AIComponent
  - All AI tools included in the engine requirements should be used
  - It must be possible to start a new game without restarting the program: if you die, you can restart the game pressing any key
  - The game must meet at least two of the extra game requirements that weren't used last week: I have a switch that disables fog of war for 3 seconds
                                                                                                I have 2 different enemies in the two maps.
    




It took me a TON of time to get this far  :D.
