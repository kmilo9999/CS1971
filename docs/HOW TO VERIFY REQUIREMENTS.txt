Secondary Requirements
------------------------------
- Multiple levels that automatically load and transition as the player continues through the game:  
                   I implemented 2 levels. You advance from one level to another getting the carrot.

  Check the class :  game.nin.NinMain  ---> how scenes are created and added to the game
                     game.nin.NinScene Line 138---> checks when the condition to change the scene. 

- Make destructible environment, such as breakable blocks: In level2 there is a line of multiple destructable blocks.
   game.nin.NinDestructableBlock
  

- Particles effect: It happens when you destroy the blocks.
  fxengine.components.ParticleEmitterComponent
  fxengine.particleeffects.Particle

- Sound: When the bunny jumps, a sound is played.
  game.nin.NinControllableCharacter:public void onJump()

It took me a lot of time getting this far.
